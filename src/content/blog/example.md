The Kenosha North Pier Lighthouse holds a special place in our hearts as it was the first lighthouse we ever visited together.

Located at the end of a long pier extending into Lake Michigan, this iconic red lighthouse has been guiding ships since 1906.

We visited on a beautiful spring day in May 2019. The weather was perfect - sunny with a gentle breeze coming off the lake. We walked hand in hand down the pier, taking in the views of the Kenosha harbor and the beautiful blue waters of Lake Michigan.

This visit sparked what would become our ongoing quest to see every lighthouse in Door County and beyond. Little did we know at the time that this would be the first of many lighthouse adventures together! ❤️
